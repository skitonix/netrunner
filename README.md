# Netrunner
By onix dev team

Welcome to netrunner

The game's theme is a cyberpunk sci-fi world

The game's story is that you're a netrunner and you got hacked; 
your biochip has a virus that you can't remove, and 
your goal in this game is to save yourself

So far the game will only be a sandbox game,
but there will be updates to add a story and more sprites
